# Breast-Cancer-Detection-from-Ultrasound-pictures-using-CNN
CNN to classify ultrasounds of cancerous and non cancerous cells


## Topic
Topic
In this notebook I will be dealing with ultrasound pictures classification. The task is to be able to tell from  scan pictures whether a tumor is benign or cancerous. I will be using a convolutional network to classify the images and will try to achieve an accuracy 
above 80%. 

## Objective
- Detect the existance of breast cancer from ultrasound images
